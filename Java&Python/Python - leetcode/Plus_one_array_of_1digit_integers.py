# Problem: Plus One array of 1-digit integers
# LeetCode URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one
# Difficulty: Easy
# Description: You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's. Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.



class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        i = len(digits) - 1
        
        while i >= 0:
            digits[i] += 1
            if digits[i] < 10:
                return digits
            digits[i] = 0
            i -= 1
        
        return [1] + digits
