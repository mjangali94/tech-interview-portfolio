# 🌟 My Technical Portfolio

This repository is a collection of my personal **React.js frontend projects** and **FastAPI backend projects**.  
It showcases my skills in building interactive UIs, designing RESTful APIs, and integrating modern web technologies.

- **React.js Frontend Projects** — component-based UI, props, state management, and AI integration in apps  
- **FastAPI Backend Projects** — REST APIs, database integration with SQLAlchemy, modular architecture, and dummy data initialization  

The goal is to maintain a **clean and organized portfolio** of full-stack projects that demonstrate my current capabilities in frontend and backend development.
