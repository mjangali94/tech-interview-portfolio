# 🌟 My Technical Portfolio

This repository is a collection of my personal **React.js frontend projects**, **FastAPI backend projects**, and **Java core & Python coding exercises**.  
It showcases my skills in building interactive UIs, designing RESTful APIs, and solving algorithmic problems in core programming languages.

- **React.js Frontend Projects** — component-based UI, props, state management, and AI integration in apps  
- **FastAPI Backend Projects** — REST APIs, database integration with SQLAlchemy, modular architecture, and dummy data initialization  
- **Java & Python Core Exercises** — data structures, algorithms, and LeetCode-style problems to demonstrate problem-solving skills and mastery of core language features  

The goal is to maintain a **clean and organized portfolio** of full-stack and algorithmic projects that demonstrate my current capabilities in frontend, backend, and core programming skills.
