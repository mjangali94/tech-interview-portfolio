This repository is a collection of my personal projects, coding challenges, and system design examples created to prepare for software engineering interviews.  
It covers a variety of technologies and concepts commonly tested in technical interviews, including:

- **Java & Backend Development** (Spring Boot, REST APIs, Microservices)
- **Databases** (SQL & NoSQL, optimization, schema design)
- **System Design** (scalable architectures, high availability, cloud deployment)
- **DevOps & Tools** (Docker, CI/CD, cloud services)
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** (LeetCode-style problems, complexity analysis)

The goal is to maintain a clean, organized, and professional showcase of skills for recruiters and hiring managers.
