# 🌍 React Places Explorer — My Second React Project

This project is a **React single-page application** built to demonstrate **component composition and props**.  
It displays a list of beautiful places around the world using **dummy data**, showcasing how data can be passed into components dynamically.  
This project is part of my **technical portfolio** to demonstrate React fundamentals with real data handling.

- Practice **passing props** between components  
- Understand **dynamic rendering** using arrays of objects  
- Learn to structure React apps with reusable **components**
