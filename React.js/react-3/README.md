# 🍳 AI Recipe Generator — My Third React Project

This project is a **React single-page application** that demonstrates **AI integration** within a modern frontend.  
Users can enter a list of ingredients, and the app sends the data to an AI-powered service to **suggest a recipe**, which is then displayed dynamically.  
This project highlights **interaction with AI APIs** and real-time user input handling.
